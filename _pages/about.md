I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), working in [Prof. Gennady Pekhimenko's](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~pekhMDL/) EcoSystem research group at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). My research focuses on **Computer Systems**, **Computer Architecture**, and **Artificial Intelligence** — with a particular interest in efficient hardware for machine learning and GPU resource management in the cloud.

Prior to my academic career, I served as an **Intelligence Operator** in the Canadian Armed Forces, where I held security clearance and conducted analysis of classified information at all classification levels. This experience shaped my analytical mindset and discipline that I bring to my research today.

I hold a Master of Science in Computer Science (2022) and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (2020), both from the University of Toronto. I also hold an earlier Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Philosophy (2011) from the University of Toronto.
