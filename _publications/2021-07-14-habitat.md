Habitat is a runtime-based computational performance predictor for deep neural network training. It predicts a DNN's training iteration execution time on a target GPU by leveraging execution time measurements from a source GPU. This enables users to make informed decisions about hardware selection for deep learning workloads without requiring expensive profiling on every target device.
